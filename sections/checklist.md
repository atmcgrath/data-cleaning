# Module Checklist

Every module in the curriculum should have these elements:

- A dedicated repository on GitHub
- A README.md file.
- Four elements present in the README.md file: 
  - a `h1` level heading with the name of the tutorial
  - a short paragraph with an accessible description of the technique
  - a short paragraph with the goals or outcomes of the workshop
  - a table of contents with links to the topics in the tutorial
- An introductory page describing the technique or technology in more detail, ideally also explaining the purpose or value of the approach
- A page or pages with installation or setup instructions
- A page or set of pages for each major concept or milestone in the tutorial.
- "<<< Previous" and "Next >>>" buttons on each page that indicate the path a reader will take through the tutorial.
- Code segments should be denoted using the markdown syntax for code and interspersed with explanations. Large blocks of unexplained code should be avoided, but if they're necessary link to a raw text file or Jupyter notebook within the explanatory text. 
- The tutorial should ideally build incrementally toward a larger goal or project and produce some kind of product, whether a visualization, webpage, repository, analysis, app, or draft writing/proposal. The tutorial should be iterative and purposefulâ€”don't just cover material to cover material.
- When possible, prefer techniques or approaches from other DRI tutorials.
- Everything substantially covered verbally or through slides in a tutorial should appear in the markdown version. Someone not present at the event or who can not hear or see the materials presented should still, in theory, be able to follow based on the materials provided in the markdown tutorial.
- If many topics or headings are included in the tutorial (more than 6), the markdown files other than the README.md should be placed in a folder within the repository labelled `sections` or similar and linked from there. (Having too many files in the files section on GitHub looks messy and is visually overwhelming.)
- If applicable, provide a `resources` section with links to sources, books, tools, or other tutorials at the end of your markdown tutorial.
- While you have the option to create tutorials under your own name on GitHub, when finished or when you reach a major milestone with your tutorial, fork it to the [GCDF](https://github.com/GCDigitalFellows) account on GitHub for reference by future Fellows.

# What we've learned

You are now familiar with how to navigate the program OpenRefine but also some basic, high-level concepts about data in general. Regardless of whether you're getting data together to do sophisticated analysis, to put batches of digitized of documents on the web, or to place pins on a map.

In this session, we learned how:

- how to **filter**, **facet**, and **sort** in OpenRefine
- how to **import** and **export** datasets
- how to **trim whitespace** and **cluster** values for consistency
- how to **transform columns** 
- how to think about structured data generally using **tidy data** inspired concepts
